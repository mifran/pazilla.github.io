So you want to go camping?
A list of things to bring is the first useful thing that most campers want, and that is the first section covered.
Later sections tell the story behind each category and their items.

Camping List
===
Here is the strategy:

1. Take care of basic human needs.
2. More items add more comfort and enjoyment at the campsite but more weight.

Here are the categories of things to bring, in order of urgency:
* Water
* Shelter and sleeping system
* Clothing
* Safety and protection from elements
* Food
* Sanitation
* Healthcare and personal care
* Education and entertainment
* Incremental comfort additions

Some situations may change the priorities, so keep in mind that depending on the conditions and time,
the order of urgency can change.

Here is a detailed list of what to bring from each category, and in later sections will be the detailed story.

Water
---
64 ounces of water per day is the amount that I plan for me on a North Carolina trip, 
and it also happens to be the amount that I bring with me when I know there will be water available there.
Used cola bottles or similar bottles are a lightweight and durable way of carrying the water if you don't
already have a container.
You will also want to have a method of purifying water that you obtain on your trip.
The filtration method can range from a commercial water filter made for camping or backpacking, to
iodine tablets that are available at outdoor stores.
Here is the summary:
* Water
* Water purification method

Shelter and sleeping system
---
For overnight, generally people think of a tent, ground cloth, sleeping bag, and sleeping pad,
and these work beautifully.
A ground cloth is a piece of plastic or other waterproof material to place under the tent to protect the bottom
of the tent from wear and tear, and it also adds additional waterproofing for under the tent.
I personally moved away from that method and I use a backpacking hammock and sleeping bag,
as this seems to be the most lightweight option for an ultralight backpacker like me--of course,
you need trees for this option.
There are many other options too. 
If you are just starting and you don't want to spend a lot of money, 
you can use lots of heavy blankets and a large piece of plastic for waterproofing, 
but be sure you are getting enough breathing air.
For a standard list:
* Tent
* Ground cloth
* Sleeping bag rated for appropriate temperature
* Sleeping pad

Clothing

More content is needed here.

Safety and protection from elements
---
Without going into too much detail until later, these items are appropriate:
* Map and compass
* Cutting tool (pocketknife)
* Two Bic lighters
* Emergency space blanket
* Emergency poncho
* Sunscreen
* Hat
* Sunglasses
* Three 13-gallon garbage bags

Food
---
You can plan your own menu.
Make sure you also have the items to prepare and eat the meal, including a stove if you need it.
Bring an extra day's worth of food.

Sanitation
---
Bring:
* General-purpose soap (castile soap)
* Cleanup kit (for dishes)

Healthcare and personal care
---
* First aid kit
* Personal hygiene
* Medical and personal items depending on your specific needs and gender

Education, entertainment, and comfort
---
Field guides, photography and/or videography, musical instruments, playing cards, 
sporting equipment, games, hobbies, binoculars, chair, fan, electronic devices,
and anything else you may wish to bring.

Incremental comfort additions
---
Each person will have a different preference for what to bring for comfort.
You can revisit each of the categories and add what you wish,
especially if you are camping near the vehicle and you have a large
amount of space in which to put your stuff and there is very little extra effort.
If you are backpacking, it is a bit more challenging to find your comfort
level quickly, and this will be an incremental process.
When backpacking, every extra item adds weight, so you want to be very
careful which items you choose to bring, as extra comfort at the campsite
means extra pain walking there and back.
