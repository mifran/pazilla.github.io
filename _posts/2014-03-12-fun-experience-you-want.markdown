title: Fun experience you want?
root: ../../../
---

There are many things I want to learn to do, but I don't have an easy way
to get into them. Do you have desires for any new experiences like I do? F
or example, rock climbin is something that I would love to learn how to do, 
but it seems daunting and a little scary for me to learn the ropes.

I've had so many fun and memorable activities with friends in my life, such as:
* backpacking, 
* camping,
* hiking, 
* biking, 
* tennis, 
* racquetball, 
* kayaking, 
* canoeing, and
* whitewater rafting.
All of those have one thing in common for me--ta friend took me the first
time I did them. There are so many fun things to do in life
with friends, but a lot of times, doing it for the first time won't happen
unless there is a friend there to help show how to do it.

With the Pazilla resources and organized activities, I hope we can all make
lifelong fun experiences with friends a lot more approachable than they are to
most people now. What other kinds of things do you want to know about? What
kinds of things do you already know that would be useful to share the skills
with others or to organize activities? Please post in the comments or send me
a note.
